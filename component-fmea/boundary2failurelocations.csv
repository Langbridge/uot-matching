Also included within the boundary are the instrument isolation, vent, and drain valves, condensate chambers for a steam environment, isolation bellows separating the process fluid from the fill fluid in the case of filled capillary-type sensing lines, and process line pulsation dampeners or snubbers (if utilized).   Pressure switches are utilized in the industry as either gage or absolute pressure switches, or differential pressure switches (as applied in liquid level, flow, or filter differential pressure measurement).  A pressure switch consists of: - pressure switch housing to protect the pressure switch components, - diaphragm seal between the process line and the pressure sensor to protect the pressure switch components from the process fluid, - diaphragm, capsule (two diaphragms welded together), bellows, piston or bourdon tube pressure sensor to couple the process pressure to the force bar, rod, torque tube, or other form of linkage, - linkage (force bar, rod, torque tube or other form of linkage) to transmit motion of the diaphragm, capsule, bellows, piston or bourdon tube to actuate the electrical switch, - electrical switches (snap-acting, mechanical micro switch, or mercury types).   In a gage pressure switch, the motion of the diaphragm, capsule, bellows, piston or bourdon tube, in response to pressure changes, causes the lever or torque tube system to move.  An opposing force is provided in the form of a spring.  In an absolute pressure switch employing a bellows pressure sensor, the function is similar to a differential pressure switch, except that one of the bellows (the reference bellows) is fully evacuated.  In a capsule pressure sensor employed as an absolute pressure switch, the capsule is fully evacuated and sealed inside a pressure tight housing.  One end of the capsule is fixed to the housing, and the linkage is attached to the other end.  The linkage penetrates the housing through a bellows seal.  Process pressure is applied through the housing to the outside surface of the capsule.    In a capsule pressure sensor employed as a gage pressure switch, one end of the capsule is fixed to the housing, and the linkage is attached to the other end.  The linkage still penetrates the housing, as in the absolute pressure application.  But the difference is that the housing is vented to atmosphere, and the process pressure is applied to the inside surface of the capsule.  Diaphragm, bellows or piston pressure sensors can be utilized in a differential pressure switch.  A force balance is achieved by the relative motion of the higher pressure sensor balanced against the relative motion of the lower pressure sensor, aided by the force of a spring.  In the case of a piston differential pressure sensor, the high and low pressure sources can be applied to opposing sides of the piston, eliminating the need for a second sensor","The failure locations for I&C - Pressure Switch are: {'Micro switch', 'Mechanical linkage (DPIS meter movement)', 'Sensing device (Diaphragm)', 'Sensing device (dp Diaphragm) and/or linkage', 'Sensing device (Bourdon tube)', 'Mechanical linkage', 'Sensing device (dp Bellows)', 'Weather proof cover', 'Mercury switch', 'Sensing device (Bellows)', 'Sensing line and tube fittings', 'Mechanical linkage (Bourdon tube)', 'Inline process snubber', 'Sensing device', 'Diaphragm pressure boundary', 'Elastomers (diaphragms, gaskets, and O-rings)', 'Electrical switch'}"
